# X24clock

I wanted a 24-hour clock with midnight at the bottom and noon at the
top.

Written in plain C / Xlib; the lowest possible level, the compiled
binary is 17k.

By comparison the standalone jar for this same thing written in
Clojure using Processing, is 19MB.  But it ran unchanged on Linux,
Mac, and Windows.
